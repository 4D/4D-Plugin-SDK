	On Windows 4D allocates an offscreen port and ask form objects,
	including plugins, to draw inside. Then the offscreen is blittered on screen.

	This may be a problem for plugin areas that cannot draw themselves in 
        an offscreen. These plugins should inform 4D so that the offscreen is
        not blittered over their area, by calling PA_SetPluginAreaClipMode( ref, 1);
	
	pluginRef is your plugin data handle you provided at plugin area creation.
	set clipChildren to 1 to ask 4D not to draw over your plugin area.
	set clipChildren to 0 to restore normal behavior
	fError is non-zero if no plugin area with specified ref could be found.
