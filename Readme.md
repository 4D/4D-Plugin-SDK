# 4D Plug-in SDK

## Introduction

* This folder contains the [4D Plugin API](4D%20Plugin%20API). 4D Plugin API, written in C, adds more than 400 functions that help you to easily create your own plug-ins to add new functionnalities to your 4D application. 4D Plug-in API functions manage all the interactions between the 4D application and your plug-in.

* The [4D Plugin Wizard](4D%20Plugin%20Wizard) is an essential tool that simplifies the task of developing 4D plug-ins. It writes the code 4D needs to correctly load and interact with a plug-in, allowing you to concentrate on your own code.
